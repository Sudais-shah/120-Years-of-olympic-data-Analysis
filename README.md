120 Years of Olympic Data Analysis
This project showcases an in-depth exploration of over a century of Olympic Games data using SQL. It demonstrates the ability to handle complex queries, extract meaningful insights, and optimize database performance.

üìÇ Project Overview
The 120 Years of Olympic Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing historical data of the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. This includes athletes, events, participating nations, and medals. The project utilizes SQL to query, analyze, and derive insights from the dataset.

üîç Features and Queries Explored
Data Cleaning:

Ensured consistency in athlete names, event titles, and country codes.
Handled missing values for medal data and participant details.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of medals by country, year, and event.
Identified top-performing countries and athletes.
Advanced SQL Queries:

Ranking athletes by medal count using RANK() and DENSE_RANK().
Calculating year-over-year trends in country participation.
Identifying sports with the most significant growth over decades.
Statistical Insights:

Median age of athletes per event.
Average medals won by countries per Olympic Games.
Percentage of female athletes in each year.
Visualization Prep:

Prepared aggregate tables for Power BI/Tableau for medal trends and country performance dashboards.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
SQL Engine: PostgreSQL/MySQL (specify which was used)
Dataset: Kaggle - 120 Years of Olympic Data
Tools:
SQL Workbench/pgAdmin
Jupyter Notebook (if Python was used for additional analysis)

üöÄ Key Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with window functions like RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), and NTILE().
Enhanced skills in data aggregation, filtering, and grouping.
Developed optimized queries using indexes, subqueries, and CTEs.
Improved understanding of data modeling and database normalization.
